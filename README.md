Use your cloud storage like a local folder. | Keep your files private on any cloud provider with crypt remotes. | Don't give up features or comfort just because it runs on a phone.

- **File Management** (list, view, download, upload, move, rename, delete files and folders)
- **Streaming** (Stream media files, serve files and directories over FTP, HTTP, WebDAV or DLNA)
- **Integration** (Access local storage devices and share files with the application to store them on a remote)
- **Many cloud storage providers** (all via rclone config import, some without)
- **Material Design** (Dark theme, custom primary and accent colors)
- **All architectures** (runs on ARM, ARM64, x86 and x64 devices, Android 7+ / 5+)
- **Storage Access Framework (SAF)** ([see docs](https://x0b.github.io/docs/#adding-local-storage-saf)) for SD card and USB device access.

Installation
------------
Grab the [latest version](https://github.com/x0b/rcx/releases/latest) of the signed APK and install it on your phone. You can also [register for the closed Google Play testing group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rcx-alpha/join), the [Google Play Beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.github.x0b.rcx), or in the near future, F-Droid.

| CPU architecture | Where to find | APK identifier |
|:---|:--|:---:|
|ARM 32 Bit | older devices | ```armeabi-v7a``` |
|**ARM 64 Bit** | **most devices** | ```arm64-v8a``` |
|Intel/AMD 32 Bit | some TV boxes and tablets | ```x86``` |
|Intel/AMD 64 Bit | some emulators | ```x86_64``` |

If you don't know which version to pick use ```rcx-<version>-universal-release.apk```. Most devices run ARM 64 Bit, and 64 Bit devices often can also run the respective 32 bit version at lower performance. The app runs on any CTS phone, tablet or TV with Android 5 or newer, but is only tested on Android 7 and newer.

Usage
------------
[See the documentation](https://x0b.github.io/docs/).

Known Issues
------------
- Reauthorization of OAuth remotes shows intermittent failures. This is currently under investigation.
